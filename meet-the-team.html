                    Khoi is mentored by Johnny Jensen, A.S.C. on his path as a cinematographer. He earned an MFA in Cinematography from Chapman University. Some works that heavily inspire him are Arrival  by Bradford Young, Maid by Quyen Tran, Columbus by Elisha Christian, and Little Miss Sunshine  by Tim Suhrstedt

So he strives to work with people who are open to creating together.</p>
